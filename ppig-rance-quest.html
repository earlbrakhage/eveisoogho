A free doujin restaurant simulator from 2011. Protagonist (Hikari) is an isekai character living in the Ranceverse, making friends with characters I've just finished my first playthrough of Rance 9 and here are my thoughts on the game. Story --------------------- 1. It is a lot similar to Rance 6(Zeth) where Rance 'leads' rebellion force to overthrow the current regime. I think Rance 9's story was especially unrealistic in a sense that Rance managed to overthrow a country fighting mostly with 20 comrades. To compensate for difference in force, this game's villains(wait.but Rance is a villain hmm) are literally one of most retarde.
