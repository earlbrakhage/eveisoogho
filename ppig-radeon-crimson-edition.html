                            <p> Yesterday, I installed the newest Radeon Crimson Edition ReLive and now none of my USB ports work, meaning I can't use my mouse, keyboard, or anything, really. This software can be found here ( I installed the newest driver possible, making sure it was the 64bit installation (I have a 64bit OS), then restarted my computer, and suddenly I'm unable to use my USB ports. Can anyone help me here? GPU: AMD Radeon Hi guys, This is my first post evr is the glorious Master Race, and i will son join with flair and rig specs. But now i need your glorious help. Hyped by the article ( on techpowerup i decided to install the new drivers. Before the update i was regularly doing some OC to the GPU (with the old drivers ofc) and evrything was running fine. After the update, with the new shining interface i was without a doubt intrigued Every time I try installing Radeon Crimson Edition 16.11.5 My OS crashes after 25%. Just after the driver seems to properly initialize. (All 3 of my monitors light up and the resolutions become correctly aligned) The only way to fix the crash is to do a system restore. (My OS become's completely corrupt after the faulty install) Older versions of Crimson Edition work fine though. But every time I try upgrading my OS becomes corrupt. Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this? Thanks. 
hey all, ever since i installed the new radeon crimson (16.1.1) driver, my computer has been freezing, but only on games that i play past about 30 minutes. this is so infuriating, is there any way i can downgrade to my previous driver? thanks again. Hey, had to format my main drive and decided to give this a go instead of CCC. HOW-IT-USED-TO-BE: Back in CCC I could manage multiple displays by simply right-clicking the traybar icon and selecting the respective video-output and either extending, cloning or whatever I wanted for my secondary display. HOW-IT-IS-NOW: There are ZERO options to manage multi displays, I don't think this even has an advanced mode anymore (I can't find it, even under the "Extra configurations" there's nothi. After that driver i got fps boost it doesnt go under 90-100 fps now but i have black bars now i dont know how to fix it. I had streched before with no problems. I apologize if this is a wrong place to post this. If you can recommend me another sub that I can post, I will gladly post it there. I tried /r/pcgaming but they dont allow tech questions there. So yeah, I updated my amd driver to the new Radeon crimson edition and now my fps won't go above 50fps. Not only that but I feel like my video streaming on youtube lags a bit more than before. I'm not really sure what I need to do to get my old settings back. If any of you can help out I will greatly. So I got my hands on one of RX 460 from HP due to compact size, and I noticed that the ODM for this RX 460 PCB is MSI, so I downloaded the 16CU unlock BIOS from https://overclocking.guide/amd-radeon-rx-460-unlocking-1024-stream-processors/ using the one provided for MSI RX 460 2GB model, I was fortunate for this card to unlock to full 1024SPs So time to test the 16CUs right? It was tested on Ryzen 7 1700X (stock), 16GB DDR4-3000 CL16, and a Micron 1100 SSD with Lepa 1600W 
So. i see in many guides to disable the GL cache (nvidia and amd ) ENTIRELY with rights management on the GL folders ( AMD and nvidia ) this is a VERY bad idea. the caches arent only used in Open gl ( Like some people could think by the name GL cache ) they are used in tons of games too Like bf1 , the witcher 3 and more. they Improve the performance and reduce cpu usage in games +less fps drops , freezes and load times. the sense behind these caches are actually the same as in Cemu shader. I have been a NVIDIA user for quite some years because they had better deals in my country, but recently I found a good prebuilt PC with a RX 460 in it with a huge discount. The issue I have is that with Nvidia users were able to use adaptive Vsync in order to get a better gaming experience. With AMD however there doesn't seem to be any option in the Radeon Crimson edition. You only have a toggle between vertical sync on and off which isn't what I want since many games can't run at 60fps I have the XFX Radeon RX 580 GTR Black Edition Crimson (RX-580P8DBRR) and am wanting to change out the LED behind the XFX logo. It's currently red and I would like to make it blue. Any ideas, tips, advice on getting to the LED itself and/or the part number for a replacement light? Thanks in advance. 
Ok so over the last 2 driver updates the radeon (crimson) software crashes when I'm playing a feed the beast minecraft modpack. The game goes white and I get a win 10 notification saying saying that the display driver has stoppped and has recovered and trying to open the radeon software gets me a this software is not responding message. To clarify some things I'm running java 8.92 And Radeon Crimson Edition 16.6.2 Hotfix Any ideas on how to fix this or do I have to downgrade Is there a reason why AMD dosent offer something comparable to Nvidias Game ready driver. </p>
