I picked up an iPad mini 5 about a week ago and it’s been pretty great, but a day or so after I got it I acquired a XS Max (upgraded from the X). I’ve been hearing that the XS Max is just as good as the iPad mini and that having both is redundant. I thought that at first and briefly returned my iPad mini for the Air 3 for a day and then switched back to the iPad mini 5. The iPad and XS Max have way different use cases and purposes for me, and the size difference is still significant. Anyone. Проверьте состояние гарантии Apple.

Previously, I had a dedicated keyboard for PC, and used the Macbook Pro as a second screen / keyboard I'm wanting to get a keyboard that: - Is wireless - Can be used for Macbook and PC, and switched between (whether KVM or some sort of multi-device ability) - fairly similar to the Macbook internal keyboard (i.e. membrane, very nice to type with). I have a mech keyboard and use it for gaming but cannot. Edit: Solved by 'Reset PC but keep Files and Settings' Option. Thank you all. Here is a screenshot if the RPC error wheb installing the driver and the secind is the texy output of the event the failure it created. https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1GlBL6J_tvbFAUk6Ky-_wWNCrBmfnQe__. i just bought rocket league on steam but i cant get i working with the switch pro controller even though all my other steam games support the pro controller. can someone please help me getting it working if its even possible. thanks in advance. thansk you guys for all your help, i actually got my controller working and i have never experienced this helpfull of a community before. thanks for being a great help sincerely DullleMan. I am selling a Microsoft Surface Pro 4. It's the i7 model with 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD. Essentially the top configuration except for the SSD, which I thought wasn't worth the extra charge. The i7 comes with the eDRAM Iris Pro graphics, making it relatively capable for the form factor. Comes with Type cover (black, UK layout), Pen (silver), charger, all original packaging, and a screen protector. The Surface Pro itself is a "brand new" refurbished one directly from Microsoft after a warranty. TL;DR: Can't find a cable that can connect my LaCie thunderbolt 2 drives to an iMac which supports only Thunderbolt 3. Anyone had this issue before? Hi all, I'm very new to this space and just been given a iMac to upgrade from my laptop. I own a few LaCie drives and unfortunetely they all have a Thunderbolt 2 connection and the couple of wires I've bought as adaptors don't seem to register the device. Has anyone encountered this? I've yet to try the apple one due to reviews and cost. What are the steps, for a layman, to transfer my btc from coinbase to my nano ledger? And how can I ensure my nano ledger hasn't been tampered with in any way (i bought from ebay) - even though its brand new, i don't want to take any chances. Thanks. 
I'm done. My replacement came today, I tested it and sure enough it was an LG screen and sure enough it's fucked. https://imgur.com/a/jZYTmgJ This is a phone that has had about 30 minutes of use. This is ridiculous. Hi everyone, I'm using an AirPort Extreme for a long time. Few month ago, I added an Unifi USG for get more control on my routing. My controller is running on Docker on my Synology NAS. My devices are 3 iPhones, an iPad, 2 MacBook Pro, one MacBook Air and and Apple TV (yes an 100% Apple Family :-). I'm living in an ~~110~~ 1100 sqf appartement in a medium density habitation. I can see around me 14 other wifi access point. My internet connection is gigabit. With my "old" AirPort Extreme Hi folks, please be gentle as I am still learning the ropes of 2D/3D animation. I recently checked out the Surface Pro 6, and to my surprise, I didn’t hate the feel of the Surface Pen on it. That caught my attention, and now I’m seriously considering investing in one. So far, I’ve been playing around with laughable low-tech hardware lying around the house, but I’ve been saving up for a good piece of hardware I can learn and grow on. I have a pretty solid PC environment for when I start heavy. Total budget and country of purchase: 0-0, maybe 0, USA Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Best specifications How important is weight and thinness to you? Weight and thinness of the laptop isn’t important Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux. Windows Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. N/A Are you doing any CAD/v. 
## My last post was modded as I referred to a not-yet-officially supported device. My apologies and am trying again from a different angle without reference to a specific device. While I have used ROMs before, I have not used LineageOS and have not run without GAPPS before. My last phone upgrade was 2013, so want to make sure I get this right and not making any bad assumptions. Please let me know if you see any issues with me getting the following working: amp#x200B; 1. LineageOS. I have been using Autodesk Sketchbook, but when I went on a plane and wanted to draw I discovered that you have to have internet to log in to use a freaking digital sketchbook. And the Microsoft Paint 3D is kind of clunky and doesn’t seem to have layers I can use. What can I get that I can use offline? Edit: thank you to everyone who responded! I ended up buying Krita, and then I realized I had bought Clip Studio Paint on sale like three years ago and y’all reminded me that my download I was given pretty much free reign to get the types of things necessary for stellar wifi throughout our home. A couple of housekeeping details first: - New house - all Major areas have a Cat6 drop. - Beginner in terms of knowledge and looking to use this to build up - 1500 sq house with a 1000 finished basement space (this will be where my office/everything is housed - House will have CenturyLink 1gig fiber - conduit that leads up to the attic space to where the equipment will be located. Just got my AP installed. Setup. Blue ring is on. Installed UniFi, won't start. I have Java 8 installed, both 32 and 64-bit. I tried uninstalling both as well and re-installing. nothing. It just says "Starting Unifi controller." I tried moving it from documents to Program Files like some recommended. Nothing. W10 64-bit Professional. I installed the phone App, scanned the QR code and I can detect the wireless network with my phone, I was on it until I enabled WPA for security. 
The guy on market place says he got it from a friend as a payment for some body work (guy owns a body shop) and just wants to get cash for it. He’s asking 0 for a 5th gen 8GB Ram, 256GB storage surface. I got him to accept 0. He has promised me that everything works flawless. I have multiple pics amp everything looks great. I had him send me the serial number amp it turns out the warranty expired exactly a week ago. Which is a bit weird? Is this too good to be true? Hi All, amp#x200B; Looking to deploy Windows 10 with M365 licensing. To date we've been using a KMS Client Setup Key during the build process but I'm wondering now we have M365 licences how we deploy? Our re-seller doesn't seem to know the process and is actually hoping we can go back to them once we've figured it out?! I believe we'll be getting a M365 key through and just assuming we substitute the existing KMS Client Setup Key with this M365 key but if anyone on here has any experience. </p>
