LINK = game.co.uk ( Also Works for US ( Elder Scrolls III Morrowind Game of the Year Morrowind: Bloodmoon Morrowind: Tribunal Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion: Knights Can anyone help? I'm looking for Better Clothes Bloodmoon Plus v1.5 ( BetterClothesBloodmoonPlus1.5.zip ). The link on GHF is dead and I really need this mod to complete I'd picked up Morrowind when it was given away for free a little while back, and today had just finished running through the main questline. (Base game, I still have Tribunal and Bloodmoon as far as major questlines go) amp#x200B; Though one thing about my playthrough was a little off. I'd been using OpenMW, since it was recommended, alongside the Patch for Purists, and the official Plug-ins, so it was a mostly vanilla experience. But after I beat Dagoth Ur, and left the chamber Hi, First of all, thank you for this great application, thanks to it, I finally could convince a friend to play Morrowind with me ! Now, while playing, she definitely finds some issues with gameplay, which I can understand since I usually mod most of them on my own solo playthrough. However, I run into big obstacles: -She wanted to have the game in French, so only french esp can be used. I may translate them, but not sure how it works. I don't know if this affect lua scripts. -I don't. I came into the series with Oblivion like many others and have faithfully played through several times of each game made since then, but of course that means I missed Morrowind. Going back and playing the earlier Elder Scrolls is easy enough, just download them and play, but Morrowind is old enough that I hadn’t played it, but recent enough that there’s still a lot of versions, upgrades, overhauls, expansions, dlc, texture packs, engine overhauls etc. to choose from. I’m considering, being. 
I'm playing on Windows 10 on the steam version, and despite removing all my mods (except code patch and MGE XE) and reinstalling, when I launch the game and click play the game or view the data files through the launcher, the game resorts my load order to load bloodmoon.esm frist, then morrowind.esm. Mlox doesn't seem to pick up that it's changed after I resort it the first time, and manually editing the lines in the ini doesn't seem to fix it either. This causes my game to give me an error. Appearance or lore wise. For me it’s the ash vampires in morrowind. It’s the fact that they’ve got the whole freaky dagoth ur thing going but they still have their relatively normal faces. They just freak me out. https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/6/6d/Ash_Vampire_Morrowind.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150529235628. I do enjoy a Giant Pile of Money (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag-ac_oVM3Y). I go to the last tribe I needed The wise woman tells me to clear a a specific daedric ruin as a safe space Wait a second. I cleaned that place along time ago! Aw hell yeah I bring her there to confirm the fact that I emptied the place Now im nerevrine of that camp Well that was really easy and fast in comparison to the others I talk to the wise woman of ukalale (whatever the hell its called) She tells me that I’m still not accepted as nereverin in all camps I go talk to the chief. I bought the Morrowind Enchanted Edition from Steam during sales. I played Oblivion and Skyrim I also researched about Morrowind quite a lot but I don't want to get any spoilers so I want to ask some of my questions about the game here. 1) I know combat is dated but I don't mind it. I play Planescape Torment right now I really enjoy the combat and people say that combat is horrible. How are mages ? I usually like to play mages but most of the time they start really </p>
