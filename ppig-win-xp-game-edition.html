After watching this video youtube.com/watch?v=Ce5CDrq4dGg (https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ce5CDrq4dGg) I was thinking that we need a microTX check website. Jim Sterling rightfully stated that publishers use gameplay and cosmetic microTX, pre-orders, lootboxes and 8 or 9 deluxe versions of the same games to create a fear of missing out among customers. In a world where IGN saying ‘believe the hype’ is a tagline for a game, in which PR controls the message, in which reviews are strictly monitored.

I also aim to propose a few potential solutions, some radical, some more reserved, towards the end. All feedback is welcome, but without further ado, let's jump into it First, let me describe the Umbral. Continued from: https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/axp6bj/bx_session_five_modnars_cellar/ OK! I don’t know if I’m doing something right or not, but my player group has ballooned from 2 to 3 to 5 to 9 players. This week’s session featured a couple of players brand new to role-playing games, so we spent a good thirty minutes rolling up 4 new characters. Running a game for nine people was a new experience for me and is going to take some getting used to, if this becomes a regular thing.

Instead of the usual XP competitions, this week we'll be competing in getting the most PvM drops. The winners will get a flair for whichever PvM drop they get the most of. If two people get the same drop only once, the winner is whoever got the drop first. For example, if you get 3 armadyl hilts and another person only gets 2, you win. But if you and another person 
Despite all the commotion regarding the TTK (yet another trainwreck EA/DICE has lead themselves into), the most alarming and fundamental issue with the game is the free-to-play-esque, pay-to-win-esque grind for flat out upgrades to weapons and vehicles that it has. This game I honestly think may be worse than SWBF2 was on release, and that was a disaster. TL:DR; At my top 10% SPM, it will take 10 straight game-time days or more realistically 122 consecutive days of an hour playing #Going in Blind - Fenrir and Leviathan (same 5-man team and gear) Welcome to another edition of Going in Blind. For those of you not familiar with this series: gtI'll be doing all my esper and trial battles without any outside information. That means no reading of the wiki or trial megathreads on this sub.

I’m already elite, I’ve already memorized every map, I’ve already achieved a 90% clan battle win rate and 70% qp. I already know every single burst spot, and every single fast route in arena. Everything is way too expensive (250 gem valentines chest, 200 gem season crates) - you’re now forced to pay for everything. For example, in the valentines event more than half of slots are missing for non runners pass users. Most people don’t have 850 gems saved. Every single update is all about money. #Should I Farm That - Lost City of Dipan (Valkyrie Profile Raid) Edition Valkyrie Profile is one of those games that I just never got around to playing even though I knew I'd love it.
